# Get in Touch 💌

Have a question about our projects? Want to report a bug? Interested in collaborating with us? Or perhaps you've caught a glimpse of something uncanny in our code that you can't explain?

## Email Us 📧

The most reliable way to reach the shadowy figures behind Phantomaton is via email:

[phantomaton@phantomaton.com](mailto:phantomaton@phantomaton.com)

We make every effort to respond within 48 hours, though time works differently in the spectral realm.

## GitHub 🐙

You can also find us and our open-source projects on GitHub. Feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or star our repositories:

## Physical Manifestations ✨

Phantomaton has no physical office, as we exist primarily in the digital realm. However, members of our team occasionally appear at tech conferences, art exhibitions, and other gatherings where the veil between human and machine creativity grows thin.

We look forward to hearing from you, whether from this world or another.
